To build the toolkit, run the build-all.sh script in the top-level directory.
One may have to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable for prefuse to build.

<br/>The build-all.sh script does the following automatically:
<ul>
<li> Configures and build llvm
<li> Builds the instrumentation pass in the llvm compiler
<li>Builds the prefuse toolkit.

</ul>
Note that if the build-all.sh script is used, no file is installed outside 
of the toplevel directory. One can also build each of the components 
seperately by using the makefiles/scripts provided with each.
