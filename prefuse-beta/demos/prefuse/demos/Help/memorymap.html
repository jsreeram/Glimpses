<center><h2>Memory Locality Map</h2></center>
<br/>  The colored pane on the left show the memory locality map for the type
       of locality measure used (spatial, temporal, neighbor affinity). The color
       ranges from violet (low locality) to red (high locality). The map is 
       divided into "memory lines" each of 1024B by default. Note that this panel 
       only responds to the dynamic call graph and not for the Static Call Graph
