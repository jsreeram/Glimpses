<br/>
<br/>Change directory to Glimpses-0.92/WorkBench. 
<br/>Scripts named profile-* are the scripts used to generate profiles. 
<br/>When run,they do all of the following, automatically:

<ul>
	
<li>   Compile the programs with the base compiler.
<li>   Apply bytecode instrumentation pass.
<li>   Run the program to generate raw profiles.
<li>   Run parsers on the raw profiles to generate final profiles in GraphML
     format.

<br/> For example, to profile the mpeg2dec applicaitons, type

<br/> ./profile-mpeg2dec

<br/>At the end of the profiling process, a folder is created, which contains
the results of the profiling and files required for the visualization of 
the same. For example, once mpeg2dec is run, a folder called
mpeg2dec_O is created under Glimpses-0.92/WorkBench.
