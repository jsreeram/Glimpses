<center><h2>Static Call Graph </h2></center>
<br/> This graph consists of all functions that are defined in the workload, one node
   per function. If the function was called during the profile run, it is colored green, 
   and red otherwise. 


<br/>The following actions can be done on both tabs
<ul>
       <li> Right click to fit the entire graph in the window
       <li> Use the scroll wheel to zoom in into the graph
       <li> Click on function nodes and drag them to move the whole graph.
       <li> Click on an empty area in this pane and drag to move the entire graph.

</ul>
<br/>
  For example, if we have a workload consisting of functions as follows
 
<br/>
<br/>  A()
<br/> {
<br/>       cout<<"In A";
<br/>  }  
<br/>  B(int x) 
<br/>  {
<br/>       if(x==5)
<br/>  {
<br/>	  A();
<br/>       }
<br/>  }	
<br/>
<br/>  int main()
<br/>  {
<br/>       B(5);
<br/>      B(0);
<br/>  }

<br/>  For the above function:
<br/>  The dynamic call graph 
<br/>		
<br/>      main.0--> B.1 -->A.2
<br/>	    |
<br/> 	    V	
<br/>	   B.3                    ---> the suffixes indicate the sequence of calls, and we notice that 
<br/>				    B.1 is distinguised from B.3	
 
<br/>   The static call graph would be

<br/>      main--> B --> A		---> one node for each function, without separating calling contexts.
				    since all functions were called atleast once in the profile run, they
				    would all be colored green.

  

<br/>   Actions allowed in the Static Call graph:
<ul>
     <li> Hover over a node to see update information in the Function properties panel
       (Function Characteristics, Alias Analysis)
      <li> Keep Ctrl keep depressed and click on multiple nodes. The function characteristics panel will 
       update to show the aggregate information. This is intended to give the programmer an estimate
       of the effect of placing all these functions on a single SPU
     <li>Right click on a node and choose any of the actions in the context menu - view cfg/ callers/callees
       - If the first option is chosen, i.e "View Function CFG", the Control Flow Graph of the selected 
</ul>
