<br/>
The left most pane consists of the listing of files in the workload with 
the list of functions in each of these sourcefiles. This is meant to
allow the programmar to identify the function as it resides in the 
source tree. The user can choose a function from the source tree which
will in turn select it on the static call graph.

<br/>There is also a search facility provided. As the user types in the name of
a function, it is highlighted on the static call graph.
