</br>The GLIMPSES toolkit provides profiling tools for understanding program
behavior and evaluating the suitability of program regions to be exected
on the SPEs of a CELL processor.

The base compiler used is LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine), a free,
open source, optimizing compiler that can be found at llvm.org. The
GLIMPSES toolkit adds an instrumentation pass to this base compiler. 

This toolkit also uses the prefuse toolkit for providing the programmer with 
visualizations of the profiles that are generated as part of using GLIMPSES.

For more information on the toolkit, please see http://sourceforge.net/projects/glimpses.
