================================================

This directory is where one can profile applications
and generate traces.

To profile applications, all one needs to do is to
create a driver script like the ones in this 
directory called profile-test (for profiling the
test application) and profile-mpeg2dec (for profiling
the mpeg2decode application). The user has to modify the
path variablesand the APP variable at the top of the script file 
APP variable needs to be set to the full path to 
application binary and its command line paramters, if any.

Then, run the script. This should generate a folder 
workload_O (Eg. test_O) containing files required to 
visualize the results of the profiling. To visualize 
the results, run the glimpses executable in the 
toplevel directory
